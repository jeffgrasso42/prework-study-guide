# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide by Jeff Grasso

## Description

I undertook this project to test and develop my skills in designing web applications in anticipation of my start in the Columbia Engineering Coding Boot Camp. 

This project serves both as a demonstration of my interest and apptitude in the program and an abridged study guide for reviewing the relevant information covered. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
